Notes: 
* A card is valid if it passes the card validation test. 
However, the expiration date and billing zip code are not checked.
Therefore, once an instance of a card exists,Â i.e. card has been 'validated', 
if another user (guest or member) want's to use that same card number the expiration date and
billing zip code must be the same or it'll be marked invalid. This will persist 
until the card is removed from the existing database. 

* A card's sec code will be the first sec code that is inputted, 
whether it's by a guest or memeber. To verify other inputs of this card's sec code
a comparison with the first input will be made.
